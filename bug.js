This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  The issue is that when the user selects multiple files, the returned URI array may contain duplicate URIs, leading to unexpected behavior in your application. This can cause issues if you're trying to process each file individually, as you may end up processing the same file multiple times.  It's also possible to get a URI that points to a non-existent file.

```javascript
//This is an example of how the bug might manifest itself.
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker';

async function pickMultipleFiles() {
  try {
    const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
      multiple: true,
    });

    if (result.type === 'success') {
      console.log('Selected files:', result.uri);
      //Process the selected files here.  Duplicates and nonexistent files are possible!
      for(let i = 0; i < result.uri.length; i++){
        console.log(result.uri[i]);
      }
    } else {
      console.log('Cancelled');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error picking files:', error);
  }
}
```
